# Webservice with a drag an drop field to upload PDFs for OCR

## done
- isolate ocrmydf docker to not be able to communicate with the outside world
- add cron_restart_script.sh (instructions inside file)
- handle errors (for example encrypted pdfs)
- added better results
- add visual feedback for the time of processing (very basic)

## Todo:
- migrate to production ready server (still flask developtment server)
